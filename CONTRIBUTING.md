### Pull Requests

The basic workflow and the only way of contributing code to the project is via GitHub Pull Requests.

- **Fork the project** to your account
- **Make your bug fix or enhancement**
- **Add tests** for your new code
- **Send the Pull Request**
- Make sure **CI is üíö**

We recommend you to create a topic branch to work on, this will come in handy when making multiple contributions or when you need to rebase your pull request onto another branch. Also we would like to encourage you to open up an issue before making your pull request.

#### What branch to send a Pull Request to?

- Backwards compatibility breaks must go to the `master` branch
- New Features go to the latest major version branch
- Bugfixes to the latest minor version branch

If in doubt, open up an issue before writing code, so we can help you settle this and possible other questions.

This module provides [GraphQL](https://www.graphql.org) queries and mutations for the [OXID eShop](https://www.oxid-esales.com/) storefront.

## Usage

This assumes you have OXID eShop (at least `oxid-esales/oxideshop_ce: v6.8.0` component, which is part of the `v6.3.0` compilation) up and running.

## Branch compatibility

* master branch is compatible with OXID eShop b-7.0 (which uses `graphql-base` master branch)
* 2.x versions (b-6.4.x branch) are compatible with OXID eShop compilation b-6.4.x (which uses `graphql-base` 6.x version resp. b-6.4.x branch)
* 1.x versions (b-6.3.x branch) are compatible with OXID eShop compilation 6.3.x (no PHP8 support)

### Install

Switch to the shop root directory (the file `composer.json` and the directories `source/` and `vendor/` are located there).

```bash
# Install desired version of oxid-esales/graphql-storefront module, in this case - latest released 2.x version
$ composer require oxid-esales/graphql-storefront ^2.0.0

$ vendor/bin/oe-console oe:module:install-configuration source/modules/oe/graphql-base
$ vendor/bin/oe-console oe:module:install-configuration source/modules/oe/graphql-storefront

$ ./vendor/bin/oe-eshop-doctrine_migration migration:migrate oe_graphql_storefront
```

If you didn't have the `oxid-esales/graphql-base` module installed, composer will do that for you.

After installing the module, you need to activate it, either via OXID eShop admin or CLI.

```bash
$ vendor/bin/oe-console oe:module:activate oe_graphql_base
$ vendor/bin/oe-console oe:module:activate oe_graphql_storefront
```

### How to use

A good starting point is to check the [How to use section in the GraphQL Base Module](https://github.com/OXID-eSales/graphql-base-module/#how-to-use)

## Testing

### Linting, syntax check, static analysis and unit tests

```bash
$ composer update
$ composer test
```

### Integration/Acceptance tests

- install this module into a running OXID eShop
- change the `test_config.yml`
  - add `oe/graphql-base,oe/graphql-storefront` to the `partial_module_paths`
  - set `activate_all_modules` to `true`
-
  ```bash
  $ composer require codeception/module-rest --dev
  $ composer require codeception/module-phpbrowser --dev
  $ composer require codeception/module-db --dev
  ```

```bash
$ vendor/bin/runtests
$ vendor/bin/runtests-codeception

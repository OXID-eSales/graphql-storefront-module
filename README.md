This module provides [GraphQL](https://www.graphql.org) queries and mutations for the [OXID eShop](https://www.oxid-esales.com/) storefront.

## Usage

This assumes you have OXID eShop (at least `oxid-esales/oxideshop_ce: v7.0.0` component, which is part of the `v7.0.0` compilation) up and running.

## Branch compatibility

* 3.x versions (or b-7.0.x branch) are compatible with OXID eShop compilation b-7.0.x (which uses `graphql-base` b-7.0.x branch)
* ^2.1 versions (b-6.5.x branch) are compatible with OXID eShop compilation b-6.5.x (which uses `graphql-base` 7.x version resp. b-6.5.x branch)
* 2.0.x versions (b-6.4.x branch) are compatible with OXID eShop compilation b-6.4.x (which uses `graphql-base` 6.x version resp. b-6.4.x branch)
* 1.x versions (b-6.3.x branch) are compatible with OXID eShop compilation 6.3.x (no PHP8 support)

### Install

Switch to the shop root directory (the file `composer.json` and the directories `source/` and `vendor/` are located there).

```bash
# Install desired version of oxid-esales/graphql-storefront module, in this case - latest released 3.x version
$ composer require oxid-esales/graphql-storefront ^3.0.0
```

If you didn't have the `oxid-esales/graphql-base` module installed, composer will do that for you.

You need to run migrations after the installation was successfully executed:

```bash
$ vendor/bin/oe-eshop-doctrine_migration migration:migrate oe_graphql_base
$ vendor/bin/oe-eshop-doctrine_migration migration:migrate oe_graphql_storefront
```

After installing the module, you need to activate it, either via OXID eShop admin or CLI.

```bash
$ vendor/bin/oe-console oe:module:activate oe_graphql_base
$ vendor/bin/oe-console oe:module:activate oe_graphql_storefront
```

### How to use

A good starting point is to check the [How to use section in the GraphQL Base Module](https://github.com/OXID-eSales/graphql-base-module/#how-to-use)

## Testing

### Linting, syntax check, static analysis
